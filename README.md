# Bacteria Eats - Survival Game

A browser-based game where you control a bacteria trying to survive in a bloodstream environment. Eat nutrients to grow while avoiding the immune system.

## Game Features

  - **Coccus**: Round bacteria with good maneuverability. Medium size and speed.
  - **Bacillus**: Rod-shaped bacteria with high speed but lower maneuverability.
  - **Spirillum**: Spiral-shaped bacteria with excellent maneuverability but slower speed.

- Eat different nutrients (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) to grow larger
- Avoid immune system cells (neutrophils, macrophages, T-cells, B-cells, NK cells)
